Hi! I'm **Camila**, a full stack developer from Buenos Aires, Argentina 🇦🇷  
I specialize in **frontend development**, creating clean, accessible and impactful user interfaces.

💡 I believe technology is a powerful tool to **empower women**, promote **education**, and bring **empathy** to the digital world. I'm a mom, a wife and a Christian — and all of that shapes the way I code and collaborate.

🌸 I’m currently looking to join projects or teams where I can grow, contribute, and build meaningful products with a **human-centered focus.**
